# DowJonesDividendAnalysis
The purpose of the data being analyzed is to find a relationship between a dividend and the average volume of each particular stock. I am using the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DOW) because it is considered a good representation of the entire US stock market.  
  
Dividend is the amount that a stocks pays the investor for holding it. The dividend can change over time. The volume is the amount of times the stock is bought or sold on a given day.  
  
In this program, I am surprised to see that most stock stay close to smoothed trendline. The smoothed line seems mainly flat. This is surprising because companies usually pay dividends to get investors interest or to keep people from selling their shares. It starts to go down around 2 percent and gets a bump around 3 percent.  
  
The stock volumes I found on Kaggle and I got the dividend by web scraping.
